This project leverages machine learning and signal processing techniques to identify bird species based solely on their vocalizations. With global biodiversity under threat, accurate and automated bird monitoring can help ecologists, researchers, and conservationists track species more efficiently.

ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To build an end-to-end system that classifies bird species from audio recordings using features like Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), spectrograms, and deep learning models.

ðŸ§  Features
Preprocessing of audio clips (trimming, denoising, segmentation)

Feature extraction (MFCCs, chroma, mel-spectrogram)

Model training using CNN, RNN, and hybrid architectures

Real-time or batch audio classification

Web interface for uploading and identifying bird calls

ðŸ“¦ Tech Stack
Python (NumPy, Librosa, TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn)

Streamlit/Flask for UI

Jupyter Notebooks for experiments and EDA
